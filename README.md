Carl Whitesel's Custom Slide Holder Files

This file was used in creation of publication data. Animals were mounted using a custom 3D printed slide that allowed for imaging both top and bottom of a mounted specimen. A specimen was mounted using a 25mm x 50mm coverslip on the bottom and a 18mm x 18mm coverslip on the top with clay feet to prevent the sample from being crushed. The 50mm coverslip was slid into the 3D printed slide, held in place by clay, and imaged on one side. Then, the slide was flipped and the other side imaged.

This design allowed for orientation of the animal to be preserved, delicate specimens to only be reorientated once, and imaging time to decrease drastically. The custom slide was printed using an Ender 3 V2, with a 0.4mm nozzle, 0.12mm quality, 1.2mm wall thickness, 20% infill, printed at 200C with a build plate temperature of 50, and a raft to prevent the corners from lifting. The build plate was left to completely cool and then remove to prevent the slide from bending. You shouldn't need supports, but if do any just tilt it on the side so it doesn't print any supports in the holes for the coverslip.
